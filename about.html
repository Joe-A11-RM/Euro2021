                    <p id="txt">Italy overcame England in the final of EURO 2020, winning 3-2 on penalties after a 1-1 draw at Wembley. Luke Shaw put the hosts in front inside two minutes, but Leonardo Bonucci responded in the second half. Gianluigi Donnarumma then
                        saved from Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka in the shoot-out, while Marcus Rashford hit the post with his effort. "We are a fantastic team and we deserve this," said the goalkeeper.</p>

                    <p id="txt">Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo took the Alipay Top Scorer award for his five goals and one assist in 360 minutes of football at EURO 2020. The Czech Republic's Patrik Schick also scored five at the finals, but did not provide any assists
                        in his 404 minutes of football. England's Harry Kane (who scored four at the finals) was the top scorer in qualifying with 12 goals, one more than Ronaldo and Israel's Eran Zahavi. The Tottenham man's haul included hat-tricks against
                        Bulgaria and Montenegro.</p>

                    <h1>Who managed the winning team at EURO 2020?</h1>
                    <p id="txt">Taking charge after Italy failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Roberto Mancini led Italy to glory at EURO 2020. The final was the team's 34th consecutive unbeaten game under the 56-year-old former Azzurri forward. "The guys
                        were amazing," he said after the final. "I have no words for them; this is a wonderful squad. This game was always going to be difficult, and after their early goal even more so, but we dominated from then on."</p>
                    <h1>Who was the winning captain at EURO 2020?</h1>
                    <p id="txt">Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini became the oldest EURO-winning captain (36 years and 331 days) as he led Italy to victory, his superb central-defensive partnership with Leonardo Bonucci, 34, the rock upon which the team was built.
                        Dubbed 'King Kong' for his chest-thumping goal celebrations, Chiellini has the brains to match the brawn: in 2017 he graduated cum laude from the University of Turin's School of Management and Economics with a Master's degree in
                        Business Administration.

                    <p id="txt"> Running from 11 June to 11 July, EURO 2020 was the second 24-team EURO. The format was the same as for UEFA EURO 2016; the top two in each of the six final tournament groups proceeded to the round of 16 along with the four best third-placed
                        finishers.

                    <h1>How did EURO 2020 qualifying work?</h1>
                    <p id="txt">Twenty teams – the top two in each of the ten groups – reached the tournament via the European Qualifiers, running from March to November 2019. Four more countries (Hungary, North Macedonia, Scotland, Slovakia) qualified via the play-offs,
                        which took place on 8 October (semi-finals) and 12 November (finals) 2020.</p>
