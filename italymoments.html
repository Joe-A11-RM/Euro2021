            <p id="text">Gian Piero Ventura has been overthrown....</p>
            <p id="text">Italian Football Federation has chosen Roberto Manchini,Where better to start than with Mancini, who became the national team manager in 2018 and has done fantastically well. Some may claim Roberto Mancini has a funny reputation when it comes
                to management; certainly from English football fans as, despite the success with Manchester City, he certainly was not known as a manager who was forward-thinking even though he was able to maximize the potential of several talented, young
                players during his time at the helm.</p>
            <p id="text">So, what was Mancini to do? He decided to focus his entire mentality on youth players; something in which has evidently paid off and he deserves an enormous amount of credit for doing so. That was his method from the beginning — the understanding
                of focusing attention on Euro 2020 and to blood young Italian players, giving them an opportunity to potentially flourish. In fact, Mancini has given debuts to thirty three players, with a high number of those players later becoming key
                players for this young, exciting squad.</p>

                players for this young, exciting squad.</p>
            <p id="text">Italy under Mancini have an incredibly unique midfield setup, utilizing the ‘Mezzala’ role. The Mezzala role is taken from the two Italian words ‘mezza’ and ‘ala’, which constitutes to half-winger. Thus, the Mezzala role pertains to both wide
                central midfielders working the channels and find the ‘half’ spaces in which is something that you see very rarely in international football because of the amount of coaching time required to implement it.
            </p>
            <p id="text">However, Mancini, with that long-term vision, was able to do implement the role to perfection. This role allows for width while attacking and is beneficial due to Italy’s inverted wingers; allowing the team more freedom, but also getting the
                best of the players that they have in those positions. Generally, that’s Barella and Marco Verrati, but both having hugely different skill sets despite being so technically gifted.
            </p>
            <p id="text">Young players with potential are always exciting, however, they are exactly that — just potential. Thus Italy made sure to include their fair share of ‘big hitters’ as well to compliment, with these players consisting of Lorenzo Insigne, Marco
                Verrati, and Ciro Immobile.</p>
            <p id="text">Insigne is no doubt in his prime and playing at the peak of his powers whilst living and breathing for playing the inverted winger role for Italy and Napoli alike. Last season, scoring 17 goals from 28 appearances in the league, while also
                offering eight assists in that time, highlights just how many goal involvements he brings and how integral his attacking influence is to his national team. When digging slightly deeper from there, a 60% dribble success rate accompanied
                with 9.5 progressive carries per game depicted his sheer importance for Serie A and Italy.
